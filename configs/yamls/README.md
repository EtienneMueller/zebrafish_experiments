# YAMLS

Why do we have yamls if we have DaCapo? Isn't the whole point to make generating
configs easy and gridsearching over a bunch of configs simple?

Yes, but there comes a point when simply making the configs is time consuming
since there are so many and or so much to configure as is the case with datasets.
Here we have a few yaml files for the most common and basic data that is needed
to create the configs.
